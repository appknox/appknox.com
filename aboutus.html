        <p class="lead text-justify">
          The idea behind Appknox was triggered by the discovery that the majority of the apps in the Android play store were vulnerable to security issues. Hackers were exploiting the open source Android operating system to find vulnerabilities and inject malware. This led to the idea of building a tool to help app owners secure their apps.
The company founded by Harshit Agarwal, Subho Halder and Prateek Panda has audited over 900 applications, and found over 1,000 threats including the ones developed by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Skype, Yahoo and PayPal.
