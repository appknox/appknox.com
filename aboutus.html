        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
          The idea behind Appknox was triggered by the discovery that majority of the apps in the app stores were vulnerable to security issues. While hackers were exploiting the open source Android operating system to find vulnerabilities and inject malware, security issues in iOS apps were not too far behind. This led to the idea of building a tool to help app owners secure their apps.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
          The company founded by Harshit Agarwal, Subho Halder and Prateek Panda has found over 1,000 threats and audited over 900 applications, including the ones developed by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Skype, Yahoo and PayPal.
